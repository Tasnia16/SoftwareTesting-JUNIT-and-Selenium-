# JUNIT :
I Have used JUnit5 for testing a java project.Here I have written JUnit test cases for "tic tac toe" java game and "ATM" an online banking java project. The test cases test all independent paths of a control flow graph.
# Selenium : 
I have tested the registration and login credentials for codeforces account and some test cases for both valid and invalid case are generated automatically by selenium.
